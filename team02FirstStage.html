<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>•   	Front end requirements: Tools?, Languages?
<br>We could use HTML for texts that contains links, jQuery, GitHub or even chrome developer tools for markup languages.
<br>•   	Back end requirements: Tools?, Languages?, Database?
<br>Scripting languages like PHP or Python can be used and My SQL for querying for databases.
<br>•   	List main functions or tasks or pages
<br>The main functions for this page would be to direct the user to choose a suitable accommodation for their needs as a student, comparing prices and conveniences. The options for each choice will be depicted in description. A search button and other links would assist the user to get to where result as well.
<br>•   	A site diagram (or blueprint)
<br>–  	defines the site structure, identifies all pages within the site, and shows the pathways linking each page. Its purpose is to organize the development of the site, and should be easily visible to all members of the team (see Chapter 03 <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/index.html">http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/index.html</a>).
<br>It provides a skeletal structure to the idea of the final result of the web site design and will be used to rectify page errors if any and will be used to guide the site creation.
